# AWS_LandmarkClassifier
Convolutional Neural Networks

This is Project 3 from AWS learning program Machine Learning Fundamentals.

The project is a Landmark Classifier for social media.
The task is to create neural networks that will process images and recognize landmarks on them.

The project consists of three parts: 
1. building a convolutional neural network from scratch, reaching an accuracy benchmark
2. taking abackbone from a pre-trained network, rewriting the head and creating another classifier
  - comparing the two, select the model that yields the best results
4. packing the best model in an app
